<b>This</b> is precipitation.  Precipitation is rain. snow, sleet, or hail that falls to the ground.  It's the step of the water cycle directly after condensation, and directly before 
collection.  When clouds get too heavy with water molecules, the water molecules drop to Earth.  Depending on the temperature, they'll turn into sleet, hail, snow, or just 
stay rain.  Precipitation is important, just like all the other stages, because it provides water and allows us to survive.<br><br>When you get excited about a snow day letting you 
off of school, it's all thanks to the wonderful stage of the water cycle called precipitation.  And when your sports meet gets cancelled because of rain, that's also precipitation.  
Finally, when hail make makes dents on your car, that's precipitation too.  So we should be thankful for precipitation, but also wary of it.  After all, in extreme cases, 
storms can end in death.<br><br>Now that we've learned some basic facts about precipitation, let's talk about <a href="collection.html">collection</a href>, which, as mentioned 
above, is the step after precipitation.</p>
