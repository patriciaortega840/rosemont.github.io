<h1>EVAPORATION</h1>
<p>Evaporation is arguably one of the most important phases of the water 
cycle.  It is, by definition, the changing of a liquid into a gas.  Molecules move at various speeds, although heat speeds them up.  Since they're 
moving so quickly, they bump into each other, releasing energy that builds up until they become water vapor.  This explains evaporation, and also why 
it works better when it's hot.<br><br>
When you find your glass half empty a day or two after it was full, that's evaporation.  If you see that there is steam rising from a pot of boiling 
water, that, too, is evaporation! When you see that rainwater has evaporated after a thunderstorm, that's also evaporation.  Although you can't see it 
in ocean because there's so much water that it's constantly refilled, dipped out of, refilled, dipped out of, and so on and so forth, it's still there! 
It's easier to see in small amounts of water, like a cup of water.<br><br>
Evaporation is one of the coolest concepts.  Now that we've learned about it, let's move onto the last but <b>CERTAINLY</b> not least stage:<a
