<br>This project, Emma's water project, hopes to teach you all about the 
<br>awesome substance that is <b>WATER!</b> My goal was to do something fun 
<br>(i.e., a website that you could explore) that would be both educational 
<br>and challenging.  I would like to thank my father, who helped me start 
<br>off, and told me repeatedly of the wonderful powers of Google, and also 
<br>I would like to thank my brother, who agreed to be the lead star in 
<br>all of my videos.  My mother, my grandmother, and my grandfather all 
<br>helped me to stay on track, and also provided wonderful feedback, for 
<Br>which I am thankful.  </div>
