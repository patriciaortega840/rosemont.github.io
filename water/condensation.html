<h1>CONDENSATION</h1>
Condensation is a stage of the water cycle sandwiched 
between precipitation and evaporation.  Condensation is the conversion of a vapor or gas to a liquid.  It happens when the water vapour comes into contaact with the cold surface of 
glass.<br><br>
When you drink a cup of milk and feel water on your hands, that's because condensation has happened and the water droplets formed on the cold surface of the cup have splashed onto your 
hands.  When you paint pictures in the glass, leaving behind marks on the windows, the droplets that you paint your pictures in are there because of--you guessed it--condensation! 
When you finish taking your shower and there are water droplets on the window, that's because of condensation too.  <br><br>
Those are the four stages of the water cycle! Next, we'll <a href="waterfactshtml">learn about the facts and properties of water. </a href>
