<h1>THE PROPERTIES OF WATER</h1><br><br>

There are many cool properties of water, many of which were mentioned on the page before this one.  However, this page explains everything more thoroughly.<br><br>
<b><i>The most important property?</i></b><br><br>
ALL of the properties of water are incredibly important! Without any of them, life wouldn't <br>
be possible! Amazing, isn't it? The properties are pretty much codependent on each other, and <br>
we're codependent on all of them! Now, we'll learn about the properties.<br><br>

	One of the most important properties is water's polar molecularity!<br><br>
	Sounds odd, doesn't it? But those odd sounding words are incredibly important to life on Earth.  It's <br>
	water's polar molecularity that means ice can float on water.  It's what causes water to be such a great <br>
	solvent (which is important: our bodies need to dissolve things in our blood!).  <i>It's why life can <br>
	survive on Earth.</i><br><br>
	You see, if water was no such an interesting oddball of a molecule, ice couldn't float on water.  And it's not a stretch to say that if ice couldn't float on water, life on Earth couldn't exist.  <br><br>

	Some more important properties are:
	1. The pH of water is 7 (if it were more basic, or more acidic, we wouldn't be able to drink it!)<br>
	2. At 4 degrees Celsius, water's density is exactly one gram per milliliter.<br>
	3. It can be a solid, liquid, or gas!<br>
	4. It's a universal solvent, which means it dissolves things really well! If it weren't such a great solvent, then our blood could not dissolve the various things that pass through it, which would be very problematic indeed.<br>
	5. It's cohesive, adhesive, and shows surface tension.  That's why water striders can lay on water.<br>
	6. It freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and 273 degrees Kelvin.<br>
	7. It boils at 100 degrees Celsius, 212 degrees Fahrenheit, and 373 degrees Kelvin.<br>
	8. It is clear and odorless!<br>
	9. Water molecules have two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (thus, H2O)<br>
	10. It has a high heat capacity!<br>
