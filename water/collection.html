<h1>COLLECTION</h1>

Collection is when water gathers. It can really gather anywhere--in the lakes, in the rivers, and most visibly, the ocean! Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water lie in 
the huge example of collection that is the ocean.  However, easy as it is to forget the little things when you can see a huge chunk of water, any place where water collects 
is putting the awesome stage of collection to work.  Even the little puddles that gather on the streets when it rains.  Water could also end up in the ground as groundwater, 
and not be visible at all.  Collection comes after precipitation and before evaporation.<br><br>When you play in the ocean at the beach, remember that the ocean is an 
excellent example of collection.  Water trickles down to the ocean.  When you splash around in puddles, or ride your bike through them, those puddles are examples of 
collection too.  When you see wells, that's an example of collection--they're drawing up groundwater, which is an example of collection.  Collection is 
everywhere!<br><br>So far we've been thoroughly enlightened on both precipitation and collection.  Now we'll learn all about <a href="evaporation.html">evaporation</a
