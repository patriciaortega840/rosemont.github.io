<h1>FACTS ABOUT WATER</h1>
<br><br>
There are many cool facts about water.<br><br>

For example, did you know that 97% of the world's water is salt water? That's a lot of water that humans can't use (it's way too salty! Our bodies can't handle the amount of salt!).  Of the remaining 3% of water, 2% is frozen in glaciers and icecaps.  We can't use that either.  At this point, you might be thinking: well, what water can we use? The remaining 1% is, luckily, water that we can drink--fresh water that isn't frozen!<Br><br>

But what if we <b>run out of water</b>? Well, water cycles! The water on Earth now is the same water as the water on Earth MILLIONS of years ago.  The only concern is that humans are dirtying the water, and sometimes making it SO dirty that we can NEVER use it again.  This is something we should actively try to work against.
