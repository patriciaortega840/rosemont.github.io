        <span class="caption">Water has a high heat capacity, which is why the temperature at which it boils (100 degrees Celsius, 212 degrees Fahrenheit, or 373 degrees Kelvin) is so 
high! The high heat capacity of water is 
very useful, because this way water can absorb temperatures without flaming up, which would be bad for humans, because 72% of the human body--is water! To learn more about the 
properties of water, click on this picture and visit the water properties fact sheet.</span> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPYk7VI.jpg"> </span>

<span class="caption">Water is the only substance on Earth commonly found in all 3 states--and solids, ice, is one of these states.  Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, 32 degrees 
Fahrenheit, and 273 degrees Kelvin.  Water is a polar molecule, so ice floats on water, which is something that doesn't happen with most other substances!</span> <img

<span class="caption">Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  To form a water molecule, an oxygen atom, which behaves as if it need 2 more electrons, finds the said 
two electrons in two hydrogen atoms.  This forms a water molecule.  In the nucleus of the oxygen atom, there are 8 protons and 8 neutrons.  However, the two hydrogen atoms have one 
proton each in their nuclei, so altogether a water molecule has 10 electrons, 10 protons, and 8 neutrons.</span><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GFfEONc.jpg"></span>

<span class="caption">97% of the water on Earth is salt water, and of the remaining 3%, 2% is frozen in glaciers and other iceforms.  The 
last 1% is drinkable fresh water.  However, luckily for us, water cycles forever, so that we <i>always</i> have the same amount of water on Earth.</span>
