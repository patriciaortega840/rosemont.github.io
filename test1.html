More than 100,000 Chinese children had been adopted by western families at Chinese government run orphanage.

American couples were told their Chinese babies were orphans, often discarded by their parents.  However, a brave reporter showed many were kidnapped by the local government to be sold to American couples for profit against their parents' will.

The picture on the left is Yang Ling, daughter of Mr. Yang Libing, before the 10 months baby was taken away by government officials in May, 2005.  Yang Ling is the first child of the Yang family, therefore it is not even about the infamous One Child Per Family policy.  Yang family was given a one day window to collect $1,600 (Y10,000 RMB) to get the baby back.  At the time, Yang Lining was working as immigration labor out of town and the poor family couldn't get the money in time.  When Yang got back, it was all too late.  The girl had been delivered to a government run orphanage in a big city, and there was little the local officials could do.  Yang was beaten up by the local officials many times for keep bothering them asking for his daughter.  Other family would have given up, but Yang and his wife were persistent, until his wife mentally collapsed in 2009 and had been missing since.  Today, through help of a responsible reporter, Yang was able to trace his daughter to the United States, the picture on the right.  However, the original contact no longer worked.

The higher level government agencies and the orphanage fabricated the entire dossier, including public notary, police report, and government records even an application with Yang's signature to claim the girl was found in a park, for the little girl to make the adoption process 'legitimate'.  According to the journalist investigation, at least dozens of babies were taken away in the same county to be sold to the western families, disguised as orphans during 2002-2005.  Many of these children were first child of a family taken away by force.

According to the investigation by reporters, among 13 babies taken away by government in one village (Gaoping) between 2002 and 2005, 3 were first child of their families.

Yang Libing is still looking for his daughter.  The Yang family is waiting for the girl.  Anyone reading this with information of the girl please let the adoption family know that the parents of their adopted girl were still looking for her.  The mother had gone insane and was missing.  The father hadn't worked a job for 7 years.  They wanted their baby girl back.  One clue, the baby's official last name was 'Shao', named after the upper level government 'Shaoyang'.

The reporter's name is Shangguan Aoming.  The cover story published on "New Century", issue of No. 18-2011, May 9, 2011.
